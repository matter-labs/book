## Overview of Anvil

Anvil is a local testnet node shipped with Foundry. You can use it for testing your contracts from frontends or for interacting over RPC.

Officially we do not support anvil for ZKsync related operations.

An alternative to anvil is current recommended in [ZKsync Era In-Memory Node](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-test-node)
